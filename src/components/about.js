        Hi, I'm <span className="name">Gretchen.</span>

        I love merging my design background with programming to solve problems.
        I have interests in lots of technology, but love JavaScript, style
        guides, web graphics, accessibility, and working with modern
        technologies to create great products and even greater experiences for
        users. I'm always learning, I get a bit better every day, I share what I
        learn, I listen to others, and I foster great relationships, practices
        to results with my team.
